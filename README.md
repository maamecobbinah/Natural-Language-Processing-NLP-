# NLP Projects Repository
This repository contains datasets, code, and resources for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. The aim of this repository is to provide solutions and experiments related to NLP techniques, machine learning models, and deep learning architectures applied to real-world text data.

Projects Overview
This repository includes the following NLP projects:

1. Text Classification
File: Ratings & Review NLP Classification Problem.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to classify text into different categories using models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, and more.
Example use cases: Sentiment Analysis, Product Review Classification, News Article Classification, etc.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This project focuses on extracting named entities such as persons, locations, dates, and other important information from unstructured text.
NER is commonly used in applications like document parsing, information extraction, and building knowledge graphs.
3. Text Preprocessing
This project covers various preprocessing techniques to prepare raw text data for NLP tasks.
Common techniques include:
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or phrases.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").
Stopword Removal: Removing common words like "the", "and", etc., which don't add much meaning.
These steps are essential to clean and normalize text before applying more complex NLP models.
Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
nltk
spaCy
tensorflow or torch (depending on the project)
matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
